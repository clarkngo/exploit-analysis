What is the IP address of the device that made the most requests to the server?

`ip.txt`

Python code:
```
from typing import List

# assumes one ip address only per line
def find_all_ips() -> List:
    with open('access_log_ips.txt') as f:
        lines = f.read().splitlines()
    return lines

def count_per_ip(ips: List) -> object:
    ips_dict = {}
    for ip in ips:
        if ip not in ips_dict:
            ips_dict[ip] = 1
        else:
            ips_dict[ip] += 1
    return ips_dict

def find_key_of_max(ip_dict: object) -> str:
    import operator
    return max(ip_dict.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))[0]


list_of_ips = find_all_ips()
ips_with_count = count_per_ip(list_of_ips)
ip_with_most_request = find_key_of_max(ips_with_count)
print(ip_with_most_request)
